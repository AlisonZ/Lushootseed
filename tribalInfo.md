Linguistic info: one of 26 languages in the Salish language family which extends along the coast from Northern Oregon to British Columbia (Ethnologue);

Language status: Currently highly endangered with few first language speakers (Ethnologue), but revitalization efforts are in progress in the form of online learning materials (Tulalip), instruction in elementary schools (Tulalip and Suquamish) as well as college courses (NW Indian College)


Lushootseed is the language native to the Puget Sound which was originally spoken in the region that spanned from Olympia to the Skagit watershed and the Hood Canal to the Cascades (Tulip Lushootseed). The once thriving language was spoken The language was spoken by the range of tribes that inhabited the area, such as the Duwamish, Tulalip,  Snohomish and Puyallup. The wide territory encompassed by Lushootseed resulted in a Northern Dialect and a Southern Dialect, kind of like Lushootseed accents (Lushootseed Research text). While this difference resulted in different pronunciations of certain sounds, the languages were mutually intelligible and speakers easily communicated with each other without losing information.

Linguistically, Lushootseed is one of 26 languages in the Salish language family. This large and varied language family extends from the northern Oregon coast to British Columbia (Ethnologue). These languages are grouped together based on their linguistic similarities, such as sentence structure, sounds and similarities in vocabulary. These similarities and frequent interactions between speakers of the Salishan languages assisted speakers in roughly communicating with each other, such as Chinook Jargon, but did not entail that they are all mutually inteligible.

Once a thriving language  Lushootseed is a currently highly endangered (Ethnologue). The last fully fluent speaker, Vi Hilbert (http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2009/01/05/vi-hilbert-built-bridges-understanding-healing-her-culture-84335) died in 2008.   Ms. Hilbert left numerous documentation of her language and begun the Lushootseed Research organization (http://www.lushootseedresearch.org/) to encourage revitalization. Other language revitalization efforts are underway in the region and seek to educate children and adults in their language. These include, but are not limited to, home learning (aka “language nests”), school instruction, and self-education. Elementary school instruction is underway through the Tulalip Lushootseed Language Department (http://www.tulaliplushootseed.com/classroom.htm) and Suquamish(http://chiefkitsap.suquamish.org/About.aspx).  Additionally, an immersive Lushootseed course is being offered at UW Tacoma in conjunction with the Tulalip tribe (http://www.campusce.net/uwtacoma/course/course.aspx?catId=90).  For self-education, the Lushootseed Research sells grammar lesson books (http://www.lushootseedresearch.org/books.php) and the Tulalip tribe provides community lessons on their webpage (http://www.tulaliplushootseed.com/community.htm). 

As language revitalization can be a difficult and overwhelming undertaking, we created this webpage with the intent to add to the available resources and with the hope that it will inspire or assist a new learner. This webpage offers an interactive learning tool to begin to learn some Lushootseed vocabulary. We encourage users to continue their learning through the Tulalip community lessons (http://www.tulaliplushootseed.com/community.htm) or other source of learning. Additionally, this webpage was created with the capacity to continue to add more content and we would love suggestions of what types of words or phrases users would like to learn. Finally, we thank all those involved in Lushootseed revitalization and appreciate the work you are doing, especially the Tulalip tribe for the use of their audio recordings.
