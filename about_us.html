              <p>Originally from Philadelphia, but a Seattle transplant for 12 years, Alison is a linguist and aspiring web developer. Her passion for traveling led her to experience cultures and languages spanning over 5 continents and inspired her to pursue a BA and MA in linguistics with a focuse on the documentation of endangered languages.  In these beginning stages of her coding career, she is looking forward to a future in computational linguistics or designing online educational content.
