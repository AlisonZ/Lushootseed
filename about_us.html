        <h2>Additional Information About Lushootseed</h2>
        <p>Linguistically, Lushootseed is one of 26 languages in the Salish language family. This large and varied language family extends from the northern Oregon coast to British Columbia. These languages are grouped together based on their linguistic similarities, such as sentence structure, sounds and similarities in vocabulary. These similarities and frequent interactions between speakers of the Salishan languages assisted speakers in roughly communicating with each other, such as Chinook Jargon, but did not entail that they are all mutually inteligible.</p>
        <p>Once a thriving language, Lushootseed is currently highly endangered. The last fully fluent speaker, <a href="http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2009/01/05/vi-hilbert-built-bridges-understanding-healing-her-culture-84335">Vi Hilbert </a> passed in 2008.  Ms. Hilbert left substantial documentation of her language and founded the <a href="http://www.lushootseedresearch.org/">Lushootseed Research</a> organization to encourage revitalization. Other language revitalization efforts are underway in the region and seek to educate children and adults in their language. These include, but are not limited to, home learning (aka language nests), school instruction, and self-education. Elementary school instruction is underway through the <a href="http://www.tulaliplushootseed.com/classroom.htm">Tulalip Lushootseed Language Department</a> and <a href="http://chiefkitsap.suquamish.org/About.aspx">Suquamish Chief Kitsap Academy</a>.  Additionally, an immersive Lushootseed course is being offered at <a href="http://www.campusce.net/uwtacoma/course/course.aspx?catId=90)">UW Tacoma</a> in conjunction with the Tulalip tribe.  For self-education, Lushootseed Research sells grammar <a href="http://www.lushootseedresearch.org/books.php">lesson books</a> and the Tulalip tribe provides <a href="http://www.tulaliplushootseed.com/community.htm">community lessons</a> on their webpage.</p>
        <p>As language revitalization can be a difficult and overwhelming undertaking, we created this webpage with the intent to add to the available resources and with the hope that it will inspire or assist a new learner. This webpage offers an interactive learning tool to begin to learn some Lushootseed vocabulary. We encourage users to continue their learning through the <a href="http://www.tulaliplushootseed.com/community.htm"> Tulalip community lessons</a> or other sources of learning. Additionally, this webpage was created with the capacity to continue to add more content and we would love suggestions of what types of words or phrases users would like to learn. Finally, we thank all those involved in Lushootseed revitalization and appreciate the work you are doing, especially the Tulalip tribe for the use of their audio recordings. </p>

              <p>Originally from Philadelphia, but a Seattle transplant for 12 years, Alison is a linguist and aspiring web developer. Her passion for traveling led her to experience cultures and languages spanning 5 continents and inspired her to pursue a BA and MA in linguistics with a focus on the documentation of endangered languages. She's a pretty big language dork.

              <p>Elizabeth has spent a decent amount of time in Adelaide, Australia visiting her now-husband and realizing how lucky she is to have a good internet connection in Seattle (so... SO lucky!) Her main interests include Art, Computers, and Gaming. Elizabeth loves art, get her talking about it and you'll soon be out of your mind with either boredom or you're some sort of art freak as-well, good for you!
